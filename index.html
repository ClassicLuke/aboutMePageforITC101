  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hi! My name is Luke Edwards. I’m a <em>computer engineering</em> student minoring in <strong>computer science</strong> and <strong>cybersecurity</strong>.</p>
  <p>I really enjoy coding and learning how computers work, using computers everyday, I find it facinating what is going on under the hood to make everyones lifes so muh eaiser and more effiencent.</p>
  <p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy learning about new technology and how it works. Things like phones, gaming syetems, cybersecurtiy devices and other fun tools and toys</p>

  <h2>Education</h2>
  <p>I study at BYU, where I’m currently taking courses in programming, physics, and cybersecurity.</p>
  <p>My favorite class I have taken so far at my time here at BYU is EcEn 224/225, where I got to build a ring doorbell and code it up. We also did some really fun bomb and attack labs.</p>
  <p>Through these courses, I’m learning not just how to program, but how to think like an engineer and problem-solver hopfully to have me prepared ffor the future and getting a job, I want mucho mula hahahahaha.</p>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>In my free time, I like working on small coding projects, such as text-based games or embedded system experiments.</p>
  <p>I also enjoy skateboarding and spending time outdoors with fiance, friends and family. I also have an addiction to a game on my phone called brawlstars. I also watch youtube a lot</p>
  <p>On any given sunday you can also find me worshipping at my local LDS church. I am a memeber of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints. I can tesitify of <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>and know the he is <em>my savior</em></p>
